## Basic Tabs

Tabs are implemented using a collection of related components:

`Tab` - the tab element itself. Clicking on a tab displays its corresponding panel. <br />
`Tabs` - the container that houses the tabs. Responsible for handling focus and keyboard navigation between tabs. <br />
`TabPanel` - the panel that displays the content of the tab. <br />
